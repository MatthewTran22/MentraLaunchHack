This is a database for a laser tag game.

Fastapi + dataset/sqlite.

- Wipe DB on startup?
- Player joins with username, get player ID
- User hits another player, we have one table to track points, and another table to track who hit who
- Get leaderboard: list of players, their username, and their score, and who they hit how many times
